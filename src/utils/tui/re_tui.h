// re_tui.h - the graphical looking layer: headers, rules, panels and boxes.
// Module: util (C11).
// Owns: everything about how a report looks. No data, no analysis, no I/O policy.
// Depends: re_strbuf, re_arena. Writes only into a caller's buffer.
//
// Why this exists beside re_text: re_text aligns a table and stops there, which is
// right for a log line and wrong for a report a person is meant to read. This adds
// the frame around it, the same way a terminal UI library would, and keeps the same
// property that matters most here: no dependency, and a plain fallback when the
// output is not a terminal.
