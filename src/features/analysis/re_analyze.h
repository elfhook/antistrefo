// re_analyze.h - one file, analysed once, with the passes that ran over it recorded.
// Module: feature (C11).
// Owns: the shared analysis context, the pass list, and the per pass outcome.
// Depends: re_pe, re_code, re_func, re_xref, re_jtable, re_strings, re_regions,
//           re_stack, re_flirt, re_arena, re_vec. The decoder is reached only through
//           the re_disasm_t vtable, so no x86 detail appears here.
